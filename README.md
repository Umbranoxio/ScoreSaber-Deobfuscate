# ScoreSaber-Deobfuscate
This tool automatically clones, builds and runs any ScoreSaber build through the required toolchain with the correct settings.

This tool assumes you have `git` and `msbuild` added to your `PATH` with little to no error handling and only runs on Windows

# Example Usage:
In order to run the deobfuscator correctly you'll need all of ScoreSabers dependencies in a "working directory", this means you must have the correct game dependencies that correlate with the ScoreSaber build you're attempting to deobfuscate 
```
ScoreSaber-Deobfuscator.exe -i <input file> -d <working dir> -p <symbol encryption key>
```
If there are problems with the deobfuscation process, run the tool with the optional verbosity flag `-v` and send the results to `Umbranox#0001` on Discord, I'll resolve it.
If you'd like to use `dotnet msbuild` instead of `msbuild` add the optional flag -l
